This repository contains some notebooks and theoretical notes used on the MIT PRIMES 2025 edition. The project is about Natural Language Processing (NLP). 

## Used Datasets

* The IMDB Dataset with 50k movie reviews. We used the version from [kere](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews). But the original dataset with more details can be found [here](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/)

* The 20 Newsgroups Dataset. It can be downloaded [here](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/)


## Draft code

Some unfinished code with partial results can be found under the [Draft_code](./Draft_code) folder.
